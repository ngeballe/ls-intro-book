# What will the following program output?

# hash1 = {shoes: "nike", "hat" => "adidas", :hoodie => true}
# hash2 = {"hat" => "adidas", :shoes => "nike", hoodie: true}

# if hash1 == hash2
#   puts "These hashes are the same!"
# else
#   puts "These hashes are not the same!"
# end

# It outputs "These hashes are the same"

# I accidentally clicked on the Solution before doing this one

# They're the same because they have the same key/value pairs, just written in a different order and sometimes different styles ("key: value" vs. ":key => value")

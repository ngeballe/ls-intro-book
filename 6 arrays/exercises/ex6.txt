You run the following code...

names = ['bob', 'joe', 'susan', 'margaret']
names['margaret'] = 'jody'

...and get the following error message:

TypeError: no implicit conversion of String into Integer
  from (irb):2:in `[]='
  from (irb):2
  from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-p353/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'

What is the problem and how can it be fixed?


Answer:
The problem is that names is an array, not a hash. So the expression names['margaret'] looks for the Margaret-th element of the array names, which doesn't make sense. That is, it asks for an array with an index that's a string, but arrays don't have string indices; their indices are integers. That's why the error message says it can't convert a String into an Integer

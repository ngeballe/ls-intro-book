# 3. What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

# Answer: Exception handling is dealing with errors in the code (aka exceptions). It solves the problem of exceptions in one part of the code preventing other parts of the code from executing--sometimes you want the exception to return an error message but still allow other code to run. Exception handling allows this.
